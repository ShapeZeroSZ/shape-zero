# Shape Zero – Master-Fractal Indexing

Hierarchical recursive memory derived from the Shape Zero fractal ontology.  
Even with random weights it produces legible structure. After ~30 seconds of training: near-perfect reconstruction at 12–14× compression with <44k parameters.

This is the engineering seed of a full consciousness-mimicking, identity-preserving world-model.
